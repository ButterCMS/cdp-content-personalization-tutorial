How to Dynamically Personalize Your Content with Segment, Personyze, &amp; ButterCMS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Important Notice
This project was created as an example use case of ButterCMS in conjunction with a blog article, [How to Dynamically Personalize Your Content with Segment, Personyze, & ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com/blog/cdp-content-personalization/), and will not be actively maintained. 

If youâ€™re interested in exploring the best, most up-to-date way to integrate Butter into frameworks like React, Node, and Vue, you can check out the following resources:

### Starter Projects

The following turn-key starters are fully integrated with dynamic sample content from your ButterCMS account, including main menu, pages, blog posts, categories, and tags, all with a beautiful, custom theme with already-implemented search functionality. All of the included sample content is automatically created in your account dashboard when you sign up for a free trial of ButterCMS.

- [React Starter](https://buttercms.com/starters/react-starter-project/)
- [Vue.js Starter](https://buttercms.com/starters/vuejs-starter-project/)
- Or see a list of all our [currently-maintained starters](https://buttercms.com/starters/). (Over a dozen and counting!)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
